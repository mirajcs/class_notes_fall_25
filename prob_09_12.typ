== Example

*Six-fingered man* 

A crime has been committed in a certain country. The perpetrator is one (and only one) of the $n$ men who live in the country. Initially, these $n$ men are all deemed equally likely to be the perpetrator. An eyewitness then reports that the crime was committed by a man with six fingers on his right hand.
